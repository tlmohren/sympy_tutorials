# sympy_tutorials

I will be uploading more notebooks in the future, but to get started you can take a ook at 
   
    ./sympy_inverted_pendulym.ipynb. 

To run the notebooks you'll need to have sympy, matplotlib and jupyter notebooks installed. To make sure you have all packages, you can use the requirements.txt file I provided:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
